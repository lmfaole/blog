          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The goal is to use accessibility to drive innovation. There are
              real challenges to solve in accessibility. Let those challenges
              drive innovation. Let them be the inspiration that lifts the
              design to the next level. Don't be satisfied with "good enough" or
              compliant. Think creatively. Think inclusively. Always design with
              accessibility in mind.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Accessibility matters a lot to people with disabilities</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Compliance does not equate to a great user experience; your
              creativity and commitment to accessibility will be the deciding
              factor in how we raise the bar for what customers expect when
              using our products and services. Inaccessible web sites are not
              just inconvenient for people with disabilities, they are blocking.
            </p>

            <p>
              You have the power to make your product better by making it usable
              by all people and giving everyone equal access to information.
              Failing to make a web site accessible has real consequences for
              real people. Inaccessible web sites take away freedoms that people
              with disabilities would otherwise enjoy, reducing quality of life,
              and making day-to-day tasks difficult or impossible. Let's do our
              part to design a more inclusive and more welcoming experience for
              all our customers.

          <h2>Avoid Exclusive Design Patterns</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Accessibility problems are the result of biased design decisions.
              Exclusion is the result of design patterns that fail to take into
              account the full spectrum of people who will use the design. Often
              these biased design patterns are accidental. Designers don't
              realize that their design patterns assume certain user
              characteristics. It is common to assume, for example that everyone
              can see and can use a mouse. Web designs created for sighted mouse
              users will cause problems for blind keyboard users.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would be a big mistake to say, "well, blind keyboard users have
              trouble with the design because of their disability." The
              disability is actually not the problem. The design is the problem.
              The design itself causes a disabling situation that could be
              avoided with a better design. It is 100% possible to create an
              accessible design that works for blind keyboard users. It is up to
              the designer to do so.
            </p>

          <h2>Designing for edge cases</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you always design for the "typical" or "statistical normal"
              user, you're missing the chance to invent solutions that reach
              even more people. Before we go too far, let's talk about the
              actual meaning of the word "normal." Normal, when used as a
              technical term in mathematics, refers to statistical probability.
              It describes the likelihood that a member of a given population
              will have characteristics that match the mathematical average of
              the population as a whole. It is represented visually by a
              graphical curve, often called a "bell curve".
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/bell-curve.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              If you target your design at the users who fall in the middle of
              the normal curve (in statistical terms, we would say plus or minus
              one standard deviation from the mean, or average), you would meet
              the needs of 68% of the users. That's a substantial majority. You
              might think that's good enough. For the majority of your users it
              is in fact good enough. But it's not good enough for 32% of your
              users.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if you took a different approach, and instead identified two
              target users: one at two standard deviations left of the mean, and
              one at two standard deviations right of the mean? If you did that,
              you would meet the needs of two very different kinds of people,
              and your design would have to take into account the middle ground
              between them.
              <em
                >You'd end up satisfying the needs of 95% to 99.7% of the
                users.</em
              >
            </p>

          <h2>Automation</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              [...] There's a lot more you can do beyond these two things, but
              you don't need a person with a disability to tell you you're
              missing
              <code>alt</code> text on an image or a <code>label</code> for a
              form element, for example. Automated tools can already do that.
              Take advantage of the person's time to gain more meaningful
              feedback.

          <h2>Usability vs accessibility</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If a web site is difficult to use, it's not always obvious to
              people with disabilities whether the problems are due to
              accessibility compliance errors or broader usability problems. If
              they can't figure out how to use your web site, they may assume
              your site is inaccessible, even if it is technically compliant but
              just hard to use with a disability. Design a good, usable
              experience so that people don't have a reason to question the
              site's accessibility.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <h3>
              Can you create a design that complies fully with the accessibility
              guidelines, but which is not fully accessible?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The answer is yes, that can happen, though the risk of having a
              terribly inaccessible web site is quite low if it meets the
              guidelines. Still, it's worth pointing out that the guidelines
              don't cover every last aspect of accessibility. In fact, the
              guidelines were written to be objectively testable, which means
              that all of the subjective aspects of accessibility were purposely
              excluded from the guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              The category of disability most neglected in current guidelines is
              cognitive disabilities, because many of the measurements of
              cognitive disability access include some degree of subjective
              judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the subjective criteria spill over into areas that many
              would consider the realm of usability, rather than pure
              accessibility, but the truth is there is a lot of overlap between
              accessibility and usability. What if a website is technically
              "accessible" (according to the guidelines) but is highly unusable?
              Could you really say that such a web site is accessible? It might
              meet a limited definition of accessibility, but it would fail to
              meet the implied intent of web accessibility, which is that people
              with disabilities can use the web site.
            </p>

          <h2>One size fits most</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              There are strong arguments for not creating separate designs just
              for the sake of accessibility:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Separate designs are rarely necessary.</strong> You can
                build in all of the accessibility you need in a single design
                for almost all kinds of disabilities (severe cognitive
                disabilities are the main exception).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Users may not activate the accessible version</strong>
                even if you create the "perfect" accessible version. It is much
                easier for a person to simply use the web site than to try to
                figure out custom accessibility options or how to activate them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stigma.</strong> There is a long history of people with
                disabilities being relegated to "the back door," both in a
                literal sense and in a metaphorical sense. Users with
                disabilities would rather use the main version of the website,
                partly out of the fear that they may be missing something by not
                going to the main version.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Maintaining one version of a web design is hard
                  enough.</strong
                >
                Trying to maintain two versions, or multiple versions for
                several kinds of disabilities, is probably too much to ask of
                your web team.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>You can't tell who has a disability.</strong> [...] The
                only option is to provide those features for all users, whether
                they need them or not. On the flip side, you cannot assume that
                someone has a disability if they access the accessibility
                features.

          <h2>Landmarks</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              In most cases, you want only one header, one search, one main, and
              one footer. You can have multiple navigation regions, but it's
              often best to limit it just to the main navigation. If you do
              designate multiple navigation regions, give them unique names
              using aria-label (e.g.
              <code>&lt;nav aria-label="Product categories"&gt;</code>
