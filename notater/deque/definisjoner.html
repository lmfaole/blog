            <dt>Inclusive design</dt>
            <dd>
              A design methodology that seeks to enable and to accommodate the
              full range of human diversity, including a wide spectrum of
              abilities and disabilities. The main goal is to create a unified
              approach to design that enables multiple methods to access the
              same functionality.

              The qualities that make a web experience available to the widest
              possible group of users. Web accessibility refers to the end
              result of an inclusive design process.

              To add a bit more detail to the definition of web accessibility,
              the

              accessibility:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Perceivable - Information and user interface components must
                  be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operable - User interface components and navigation must be
                  operable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Understandable - Information and the operation of user
                  interface must be understandable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be
                  interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents,
                  including assistive technologies.
                </li>
              </ol>

            <dd>
              The qualities that make a web experience intuitive and easy to
              use. A usable web design aligns with the purpose for which the web
              site was created.
