            <h3>The goal is to use accessibility to drive innovation.</h3>
            <p>
              There are real challenges to solve in accessibility. Let those
              challenges drive innovation. Let them be the inspiration that
              lifts the design to the next level. Don't be satisfied with "good
              enough" or compliant. Think creatively. Think inclusively. Always
              design with accessibility in mind.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessibility matters a lot to people with disabilities</h3>
            <p>
              Compliance does not equate to a great user experience; your
              creativity and commitment to accessibility will be the deciding
              factor in how we raise the bar for what customers expect when
              using our products and services. Inaccessible web sites are not
              just inconvenient for people with disabilities, they are blocking.
            </p>

            <p>
              You have the power to make your product better by making it usable
              by all people and giving everyone equal access to information.
              Failing to make a web site accessible has real consequences for
              real people. Inaccessible web sites take away freedoms that people
              with disabilities would otherwise enjoy, reducing quality of life,
              and making day-to-day tasks difficult or impossible. Let's do our
              part to design a more inclusive and more welcoming experience for
              all our customers.

          <h2>Designing an Accessible User Experience</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <h3>
              Can you create a design that complies fully with the accessibility
              guidelines, but which is not fully accessible?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The answer is yes, that can happen, though the risk of having a
              terribly inaccessible web site is quite low if it meets the
              guidelines. Still, it's worth pointing out that the guidelines
              don't cover every last aspect of accessibility. In fact, the
              guidelines were written to be objectively testable, which means
              that all of the subjective aspects of accessibility were purposely
              excluded from the guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              The category of disability most neglected in current guidelines is
              cognitive disabilities, because many of the measurements of
              cognitive disability access include some degree of subjective
              judgment.
            </p>
            <h4>Usability vs accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              Many of the subjective criteria spill over into areas that many
              would consider the realm of usability, rather than pure
              accessibility, but the truth is there is a lot of overlap between
              accessibility and usability. What if a website is technically
              "accessible" (according to the guidelines) but is highly unusable?
              Could you really say that such a web site is accessible? It might
              meet a limited definition of accessibility, but it would fail to
              meet the implied intent of web accessibility, which is that people
              with disabilities can use the web site.

              A design methodology that seeks to enable and to accommodate the
              full range of human diversity, including a wide spectrum of
              abilities and disabilities. The main goal is to create a unified
              approach to design that enables multiple methods to access the
              same functionality.

                  Perceivable - Information and user interface components must
                  be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operable - User interface components and navigation must be
                  operable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Understandable - Information and the operation of user
                  interface must be understandable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be
                  interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents,
                  including assistive technologies.
