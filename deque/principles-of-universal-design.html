            These principles were first described in

        <p>
          A group of architects led by Ronald Mace at North Carolina State
          University called into question approaches to designing buildings,
          products, and environments. Mace and his group of architects realized
          that individuals are diverse and design of physical environments and
          products should be adaptable to individuals' needs. Together, the
          architects concluded that physical spaces and products should be
          "universal".
        </p>
        <p>
          Realizing that spaces and products should be designed for universal
          use, the group of architects developed seven principles to guide those
          working in the field in universal design. Though these seven
          principles were intended to be applied to architectural and industrial
          design, these principles have been a point of reference to applying
          universal design to other areas such as education and web design.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Equitable Use</h2>
        <p>
          Goal: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse
          abilities.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever
            possible; equivalent when not.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.</li>
          <li>
            Make provisions for privacy, security, and safety equally available
            to all users.
          </li>
          <li>Make the design appealing to all users.</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote class="example good">
          <p>
            A web site uses semantic markup in all the appropriate places
            (headings, landmarks, table structure, form labels, etc.) and
            creates a single design that works well for users who are sighted as
            well as for users who are blind.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="grid 2">
          <blockquote class="example bad">
            <p>
              A web site with a separate version for people with disabilities.
              Even if the intention is to make that second version more
              accessible than the main version, it's a bad idea.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote class="example bad">
            <p>
              A web site for booking hotel rooms is inaccessible to screen
              reader users, but prominently places information about a phone
              number that people who are blind can call to book a room by phone.
              The phone experience is technically accessible, but it is not an
              equivalent experience to an accessible web site, and operators are
              not available after certain hours.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Flexibility in Use</h2>
        <p>
          Goal: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences
          and abilities.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Provide choice in methods of use.</li>
          <li>Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.</li>
          <li>Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.</li>
          <li>Provide adaptability to the user's pace.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Simple and Intuitive Use</h2>
        <p>
          Goal: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the
          user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current
          concentration level.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Eliminate unnecessary complexity.</li>
          <li>Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.</li>
          <li>Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.</li>
          <li>Arrange information consistent with its importance.</li>
          <li>
            Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task
            completion.
          </li>
